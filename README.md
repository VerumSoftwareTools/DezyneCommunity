# Dezyne Community repository

This repository is available to share anything related to Dezyne between Dezyne users. Dezyne is the Component Based, Model Driven Software Engineering tool made by Verum Software Tools B.V. (https://www.verum.com/)

First of all, see https://www.verum.com/support/tutorials/ for the online tutorials and examples, they are really good to get you started!

# Arduino

[Arduino_IDE_Guidelines page](https://github.com/VerumSoftwareTools/DezyneCommunity/tree/master/Arduino_IDE_Guidelines) describes an example of an Arduino based project including settings in the tool and example code.

# Armours

[The Errors and armours page](https://github.com/VerumSoftwareTools/DezyneCommunity/tree/master/Error_situations_and_armours) describes error situations for which armouring could be applied and provides examples of such Armours.

# Dezyne meets Unity

[DezyneMeetsUnity](https://github.com/VerumSoftwareTools/DezyneCommunity/tree/master/DezyneMeetsUnity) describes a tutorial for building a link between a controlling server in dezyne and a client in Unity (3D virtualization platform).

# DezynePatterns

[DezynePatterns](https://github.com/VerumSoftwareTools/DezyneCommunity/tree/master/DezynePatterns) describes some standard designer challenges and how to solve those in Dezyne. This is inspired by the famous DesignPatterns of Object Oriented Design.

# SubState Machines

[The SubState Machines page](https://github.com/VerumSoftwareTools/DezyneCommunity/tree/master/substatemachine_Dezyne2_5_x) explains how a sub-state machine can be implemented, even without the native support of sub-state-machine syntax in the dezyne language. (native support is currently under development)

# Logging

[This page](https://github.com/VerumSoftwareTools/DezyneCommunity/tree/master/logging) describes a way to inject a StreamLogger class into the locator to re-direct the logging to your own logger intra-structure. Also it goes into how it is possible to customize the log information coming out of dezyne models by customizing the runtime.
